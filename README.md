droso.time.Fig1.tre: Timetree (and HPD intervals) estimated in BEAST (Figure 1)

ML.tre: Maximum likehood tree inferred in RAxML (this topology was fixed during the estimation of divergence times in BEAST)

align.fas: concatenated alignment used in BEAST and RAxML

AlignAndTrees.CorrectedNames.nex: ML tree (RAxML), timetree (BEAST, without HPDs) and concatenated alignment with complete species names.
